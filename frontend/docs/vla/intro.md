# VLA Module Introduction

Welcome to the VLA (Vision-Language-Action) module. This section covers Vision-Language-Action models for robotic manipulation, focusing on how AI models that combine visual understanding, language processing, and action generation enable more capable and intuitive robotic systems.

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Understand the fundamentals of Vision-Language-Action models
- Implement VLA systems for robotic manipulation tasks
- Design human-robot interaction using natural language
- Apply foundation models to robotic control

## Module Overview

The VLA module is organized into the following chapters:
- Chapter 1: VLA Fundamentals - Vision, language, and action integration
- Chapter 2: VLA Systems - Implementing robotic systems with VLA models

Each chapter includes theoretical explanations, practical code examples, diagrams, and exercises to reinforce your learning.
