# Gazebo/Unity Module Introduction

Welcome to the Gazebo/Unity module. This section covers simulation environments for robotics development, focusing on both the Gazebo physics simulator and Unity game engine approaches for robot simulation and testing.

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Set up and configure Gazebo and Unity simulation environments
- Create realistic robot models and environments
- Implement physics-based simulations with accurate dynamics
- Use simulation for robot development and testing

## Module Overview

The Gazebo/Unity module is organized into the following chapters:
- Chapter 1: Gazebo Fundamentals - Physics simulation and model creation
- Chapter 2: Unity Robotics - Game engine approaches to robotics simulation
- Chapter 3: Simulation Integration - Connecting simulators to ROS2

Each chapter includes theoretical explanations, practical code examples, diagrams, and exercises to reinforce your learning.
