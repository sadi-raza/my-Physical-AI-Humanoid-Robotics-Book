# Capstone Module Introduction

Welcome to the Capstone module. This section integrates all the concepts learned in previous modules to design and implement advanced humanoid robotics systems. The capstone focuses on real-world applications, system integration, and advanced topics in Physical AI.

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Design and implement complete humanoid robotics systems
- Integrate multiple robotics frameworks and technologies
- Apply advanced AI techniques to complex robotic problems
- Evaluate and optimize integrated robotic systems

## Module Overview

The Capstone module is organized into the following chapters:
- Chapter 1: System Integration - Combining ROS2, simulation, Isaac, and VLA
- Chapter 2: Advanced Applications - Complex humanoid robotics implementations

Each chapter includes theoretical explanations, practical code examples, diagrams, and exercises to reinforce your learning.
