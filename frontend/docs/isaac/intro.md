# Isaac Module Introduction

Welcome to the Isaac module. This section covers NVIDIA Isaac, a comprehensive robotics platform that includes Isaac Sim for simulation, Isaac ROS for perception and navigation, and Isaac Lab for reinforcement learning research.

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Set up and configure the NVIDIA Isaac platform
- Use Isaac Sim for high-fidelity robotics simulation
- Implement perception and navigation pipelines with Isaac ROS
- Apply reinforcement learning techniques with Isaac Lab

## Module Overview

The Isaac module is organized into the following chapters:
- Chapter 1: Isaac Sim - High-fidelity simulation and digital twin creation
- Chapter 2: Isaac ROS - Perception and navigation with GPU acceleration
- Chapter 3: Isaac Applications - Real-world robotics implementations

Each chapter includes theoretical explanations, practical code examples, diagrams, and exercises to reinforce your learning.
